## About the project 
A rock paper scissors game to have some fun ðŸŽ®. 

## Why i built it 
I wanted to build something interactive and a game is the perfect project idea for that. 

## How i built that 
I used vanilla javascript plus some html and css. 

## What i learned
A couple of things : 
- Change the style of an html element when i move the cursor above it. 
- learn the difference between const, let and var. 
- how to use querySelector(). 
- Use the switch statement. 
- Use functions inside other functions. 
- Break the app into little compenets. 
- Function naming method: functionExampleName().
